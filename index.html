    <h1> Correlations </h1>
    
    
    <ol>
        <li>A correlation is a relationship between variables and can only be a relationship when the relationship is linear. Correlations are used in order to show or discuss a relationship between two or more variables</li>
        <li>In the most basic sense, a correlation is a possible relationship while a causation means they a definite relationship. Causations can be foudn from correlation by using experiments to make sure that the variables that you are seeing repeat themselves in a vareity of circumstances.</li>
        <li>Compare and Contrast:
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Smooth Scatter Plot</li>
                <li>Matrix Plot</li>
                <li>Parralel Coordinate Plot</li>
            
            </ol>
            <p>
            
            Each one serves a specific reason for being used. A smooth scatter might be more useful whe a linear line wont be the best way to tell, but there is still good data within the gragh used. So instead of a straight line you can use a curve for better visuals. Unlike the other two you can keep the original scatter plot. At the same time if there are multiple gatherings of similar data over time this would be the best to use. On the other hand a Matrix is very helpful for comparing a lot of data, however is horrible for correlation unlike scatter and coordinate. Parralel is very nice for a lot of data and correlation, but the designer needs to add more features in order to make it easier to read for the user. And this the corrdinate takes the most user interactivity.

    <i>What is correlation used for?</i><br>
It is used to describe the linear relationship between two quantitative variable. From the correlation, we can know the strength and the direction of the relationship between those two variables.<br>
    <i>What is the difference between correlation and causation?</i> <br>
Causation means there is a casue and effect relationship that the change in one variable can cause the change of another. The occurance of causation might suggest a correlation, but a correlation does not mean there is a causation because the correlation is just simply indicating the relationship between two. <br>

    An example to see a correlation doesn't imply a causation.

    <h2>3 different ways to visually show relationships</h2>
    <p>
    <i>Smoothers with the scatter plot:</i> can give us a basic outlook of the trend of the data and the relationship between two variables as creating a line through. However, the smoother is not accurate. 
    <br>
    <i>Matrices and Parallel coordinate plots:</i> which will be easier for us to compare between different sections, but will be hard to tell the correlation within the section if there are a lot of data. <br>
    
    <i>Regression:</i>the linear least suqare recession can help us not only to see the relationship between the two variables by showing the change of the dependent variable when the independent variable changes by 1 unit, but also to estimate the value that is included in the data. It is more accurate than the smoother, but it can not compare with other like the matrices and pareller coordinate plot does.
