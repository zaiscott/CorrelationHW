    <h1> Correlations </h1>
    
    
    <ol>
        <li>A correlation is a relationship between variables and can only be a relationship when the relationship is linear. Correlations are used in order to show or discuss a relationship between two or more variables</li>
        <li>In the most basic sense, a correlation is a possible relationship while a causation means they a definite relationship. Causations can be foudn from correlation by using experiments to make sure that the variables that you are seeing repeat themselves in a vareity of circumstances.</li>
        <li>Compare and Contrast:
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Smooth Scatter Plot</li>
                <li>Matrix Plot</li>
                <li>Parralel Coordinate Plot</li>
            
            </ol>
            <p>
            
            Each one serves a specific reason for being used. A smooth scatter might be more useful whe a linear line wont be the best way to tell, but there is still good data within the gragh used. So instead of a straight line you can use a curve for better visuals. Unlike the other two you can keep the original scatter plot. At the same time if there are multiple gatherings of similar data over time this would be the best to use. On the other hand a Matrix is very helpful for comparing a lot of data, however is horrible for correlation unlike scatter and coordinate. Parralel is very nice for a lot of data and correlation, but the designer needs to add more features in order to make it easier to read for the user. And this the corrdinate takes the most user interactivity.
