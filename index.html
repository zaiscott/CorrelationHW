    <h1> Correlations </h1>
    
    
    <ol>
        <li>A correlation is a relationship between different variables and only a relatioship when it is linear.</li>
        <li>Causation shows a definite relatioship based of those variables showing a correlation however correlation does not mean caustion. The relationship in a causation shows that a cirtain variable is dependent on another.</li>
        <li> 3 different ways to visually show relationships</li>
            <ul><b>Smoothers with the scatter plot: </b> gives a basic idea on the trends and relatioship between the data by creating a line.</ul> 
            <ul> <br> </ul>
            <ul><b>Matrices and Parallel coordinate plots: </b> Easy to compare different sections of data but can be difficult to find a relatioship or correltation if there is a lot of data present. </ul>
            <ul> <br> </ul>
            <ul><b>Regression: </b>the most least linear least section's recession can help us to see the relationship between the two variables, and also to estimate the value that is included in the data.</ul>
