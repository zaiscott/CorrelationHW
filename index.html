    <h1> Correlations </h1>
    
    
    <ol>
        <li>A correlation is a relationship between different variables and only a relatioship when it is linear.</li>
        <li>Causation shows a definite relatioship based of those variables showing a correlation however correlation does not mean caustion. The relationship in a causation shows that a cirtain variable is dependent on another.</li>
        <li> 3 different ways to visually show relationships</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    <b>Smoothers with the scatter plot: </b> can give us a basic outlook of the trend of the data and the relationship between two variables as creating a line through. However, the smoother is not accurate. 
    <br>
    <b>Matrices and Parallel coordinate plots: </b> which will be easier for us to compare between different sections, but will be hard to tell the correlation within the section if there are a lot of data. <br>
    
    <b>Regression: </b>the linear least suqare recession can help us not only to see the relationship between the two variables by showing the change of the dependent variable when the independent variable changes by 1 unit, but also to estimate the value that is included in the data. It is more accurate than the smoother, but it can not compare with other like the matrices and pareller coordinate plot does.
